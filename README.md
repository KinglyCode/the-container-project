# The Container Shop
### For all collectable needs!

# About The App
```
The Container App is an e-commerce webpage that shows data on different types of collectables and trading cards. 
Where you can "buy" your favorite character in a FunkoPop or favorite trading card. 
(For context, this app has 'fake' data. You cannot buy anything on this site. 
Everything is there for show and how I've coded this app!)

# Unsolved Problems
```
The All Categories area isn't there as I am currently trying to figure out how to get the data in there
Also, can't get to confirmation page after clicking 'Pay Now' as I also need to figure how to get to another page with that.
```
# Future Additions
```
  1. Adding a user profile page.
  2. Implementing a confirmation page
  3. Getting all data on another page.
  4. Using CSS to add a cart counter to the 'My Cart' link.
```
